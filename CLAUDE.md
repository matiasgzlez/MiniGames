# MiniGames

Monorepo of small browser minigames (Neon Cylinder, Flappy Bird, Stack Tower, Rhythm Tap, Jump Ball, Reaction Time, City Bloxx, Sliding Puzzle, Asteroids, Mini Frogger, and Kunai Throw), each independently playable, plus a landing page to pick one. Stack: Vite + TypeScript, no framework. Deployed as a static site (Vercel).

## Conventions (must follow)

- **Never use emojis** anywhere — not in code, UI, comments, commit messages, or docs.
- **Keep `CLAUDE.md` files up to date with every change.** When structure, commands, conventions, or the game roster change, update the relevant `CLAUDE.md` (this root file and/or the per-game one) in the same change.
- **Never add yourself (Claude) as a co-author on commits.** Do not append `Co-Authored-By` trailers or any AI attribution to commit messages.
- **Use the installed `threejs-*` skills when building 3D games.** For any game using Three.js (scenes, cameras, geometry, materials, lighting, textures, animation, model loaders, shaders, postprocessing, raycasting/interaction), consult the matching `threejs-*` skill for accurate APIs and patterns instead of relying on memory.
- **Every game must have the Enter-to-start 3 / 2 / 1 / YA countdown.** No game may jump straight from the start / game-over screen into play — it must go through the shared countdown described below. New games are required to implement it.

## Structure

- `index.html`, `src/main.ts`, `src/style.css` — the landing page. Renders a card per game from `src/games.ts`, plus a "Jugar con amigos" link to `/rooms/` (only when Supabase credentials exist).
- `src/games.ts` — registry (`GameEntry[]`: `id`, `title`, `description`, `path`, optional `accent` color) the landing page reads. **Every game needs an entry here.**
- `games/<id>/index.html` — one Vite HTML entry point per game (root-level `games/`, not under `src/`), giving each game a clean URL `/games/<id>/`.
- `src/games/<id>/` — that game's source (`main.ts`, `style.css`, plus its own submodules, e.g. `game/`).
- `src/shared/` — cross-cutting leaderboard infra shared by every game and the landing page (see "Global rankings" below), plus `src/shared/room/` (multiplayer rooms, see "Salas" below). This is the **one** sanctioned shared module; it is not game-engine code.
- `rooms/index.html` + `src/rooms/` — the multiplayer rooms page (create / join / lobby) at `/rooms/`. Not a game, so it lives outside `games/`.
- `vite.config.ts` — auto-discovers every `games/*/index.html` via `node:fs` at config-load time and feeds them into `build.rollupOptions.input`. New games are picked up automatically; **no edit needed here** when adding a game. The only hand-registered extra entry is `rooms/index.html`.
- `public/` — static assets shared across all games (favicon, icons).
- Each game folder under `src/games/<id>/` has its own `CLAUDE.md` with game-specific context (mechanics, gotchas, tuning knobs).

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server (each game reachable at `/games/<id>/`, landing page at `/`).
- `npm run build` — `tsc` type-check then `vite build`; verify by checking the output for a `dist/games/<id>/index.html` line per game.
- `npm run preview` — serve the production build locally.

## Adding a new minigame

1. Create `src/games/<id>/` with `main.ts`, `style.css`, and any submodules.
2. Create `games/<id>/index.html` mirroring `games/neon-cylinder/index.html` (script `src="/src/games/<id>/main.ts"`; optional `.back-link` anchor to `/` to return to the landing page).
3. Add an entry to `src/games.ts`.
4. Add a `CLAUDE.md` inside `src/games/<id>/` documenting that game's mechanics and any non-obvious decisions.
5. Implement the mandatory Enter-to-start 3 / 2 / 1 / YA countdown (see "Shared UX pattern" below).
6. Wire the global ranking (see "Global rankings" below): declare the game in `GAME_SCORING` and call `hud.showRanking(...)` on game over.
7. Wire the multiplayer room mode (see "Salas (multiplayer rooms)" below): `initRoomMode(<id>, { getScore })` in the constructor, block the restart input on game over when `this.room` is set, and call `this.room.reportScore(score)` instead of `hud.showRanking(...)`.
8. Run `npm run build` to confirm the new entry is discovered.

Games are intentionally decoupled — no shared game-engine code between them. Don't introduce a shared abstraction across games unless a second game actually needs it. The lone exception is `src/shared/` (global rankings), which is deliberately cross-cutting infra, not gameplay logic.

## Global rankings

Every game reports its final score to a shared global leaderboard backed by **Supabase** (Postgres + client SDK called straight from the browser with the anon key and Row Level Security — no server code). Lives in `src/shared/`:

- `supabase.ts` — lazy client from `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`; `getSupabase()` returns `null` when unset. `isLeaderboardEnabled()` gates optional UI.
- `scoring.ts` — `GAME_SCORING[gameId]`: per-game `direction` (`"higher"` = bigger is better, default; `"lower"` for reaction-time and sliding-puzzle), optional `format`, and optional `variants` (independent boards, e.g. sliding-puzzle sizes). **Every game that submits must have an entry here.**
- `nickname.ts` — anonymous player name in `localStorage` (`mg:nickname`, 1-12 chars).
- `leaderboard.ts` — `submitScore(gameId, score, { variant })` and `fetchTop(gameId, { variant, limit })`.
- `LeaderboardPanel.ts` — self-contained DOM component (injects its own CSS once). Prompts for the nickname on every submit, prefilled with the last used name as an editable suggestion; the score is sent only after the player confirms. Then shows the Top 10 and highlights the player's row. Reused by each game's game-over overlay and by the landing modal.

Config & degradation:
- Credentials go in `.env` (gitignored; see `.env.example`) and in Vercel's env vars. The DB schema is `supabase/schema.sql`.
- **Degrades gracefully:** with no credentials the games play normally, local bests still persist, and the ranking UI just doesn't appear. Never make gameplay depend on the leaderboard.
- Security note: scores are inserted client-side with the anon key, so they are spoofable — acceptable for minijuegos; move the insert behind a serverless function if it ever matters.

Per-game wiring: each `Game.ts` calls `this.hud.showRanking(<id>, score[, size])` right after saving the local best in its game-over handler; each `Hud` mounts a `LeaderboardPanel` in its overlay, exposes `showRanking(...)`, and calls `leaderboard.clear()` in `showStart`. Landing (`src/main.ts`) adds a per-card "Ranking" button that opens a read-only modal (with a variant selector for games that declare `variants`).

## Salas (multiplayer rooms)

Party mode: a host creates a room (short shareable code), friends join, and everyone plays the same minigame simultaneously on their own device; each round awards points by placement (1st of N players gets N points, direction-aware via `GAME_SCORING`), with a cumulative scoreboard and a winner at the end. Room settings (host): number of rounds or an explicit playlist, plus a per-round time limit; without a playlist, after each round players vote the next game among 3 random not-yet-played candidates. In the lobby the host sees the settings form (shared `buildSettingsForm` in `src/rooms/main.ts`) and can re-pick games/rounds/time before every match — each change is saved via `updateSettings` and pinged live to the others, who see a read-only summary. The room survives the final board: the host's "Jugar otra vez" (`resetRoom`) wipes rounds/scores/votes and sends everyone back to the lobby with the same players, where new games can be chosen for the rematch; registered players can rejoin even a finished room, only brand-new players are rejected until it returns to the lobby. Design doc: `docs/salas-plan.md`.

Architecture (Supabase, no server code):
- **Postgres is the source of truth** — tables `rooms`, `room_players`, `room_rounds`, `room_round_scores`, `room_votes` in `supabase/rooms.sql` (run it in the SQL Editor besides `schema.sql`). Durable state is what makes rejoin and page navigation work: every game is its own HTML entry, so navigating drops the Realtime channel and each page reconnects + refetches.
- **Realtime channel per room** (`room:<CODE>`) with presence (key = nickname) and a single broadcast event `sync` meaning "re-read the DB" (write -> ping -> refetch, plus a 5 s poll fallback). No `postgres_changes`.
- **Host-authoritative**: only the host writes phase transitions (start/close round, open vote, finish); players write only their own rows. Points are computed client-side by the pure functions in `points.ts`. If the host disappears >20 s in a stable phase, anyone can take over.
- Same spoofable trust level as `scores` (anon key + open RLS policies) — accepted and documented in the SQL.

Files in `src/shared/room/`: `types.ts` (types + settings constants), `api.ts` (CRUD, no-op without credentials), `channel.ts` (`RoomChannel`), `points.ts` (`rankRound` / `computeTotals`, pure), `RoomOverlay.ts` (self-contained fixed full-screen DOM overlay: waiting / results / voting / final + top strip), `roomMode.ts` (orchestrator + the per-game contract).

Per-game wiring (the only game-side code, ~4 lines in each `Game.ts`, `Hud.ts` untouched):
- `private readonly room = initRoomMode("<id>", { getScore: () => this.score });` in the constructor. Returns `null` without `?room=` in the URL or without Supabase — zero impact outside room mode.
- In the game-over restart input path: `if (this.room) return;` (one run per round; the overlay covers the game's own game-over screen).
- In the game-over handler: `if (this.room) this.room.reportScore(score); else this.hud.showRanking(...)`. Room scores are **not** sent to the global leaderboard (timeout-cut runs would pollute it).
- `getScore` is the live score for the timeout partial. Special cases: reaction-time reports the average of completed rounds; sliding-puzzle is fixed to 4x4 in room mode (`ROOM_VARIANTS`) and hides its size selector.

Degradation matches the leaderboard: without credentials the landing button and `/rooms/` UI don't function and every game behaves exactly as before.

## Shared UX pattern: Enter-to-start countdown

Every game starts the same way: from the start / game-over screen, Enter (or a tap) enters a `countdown` state that shows 3 / 2 / 1 / YA before play begins, then the run starts. The pattern is duplicated per game (not shared code, per the decoupling rule): each `Game.ts` has a `countdown` state plus `COUNTDOWN_LABELS` / `COUNTDOWN_STEP` constants and a `beginCountdown()`; each `Hud` has `showCountdown(text | null)`; each `style.css` has the `.countdown` label styling and `countdown-pop` keyframes. This is mandatory — every game must implement this pattern (see the Conventions rule above); new games are not complete without it.
