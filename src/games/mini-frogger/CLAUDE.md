## Collisions

The frog is always logically inside its own lane row (`frog.gridY` picks the lane), so hit-testing is a **1D horizontal** test, not an AABB — done in `Game.update`:

- The frog's centre is `frog.x + GRID_SIZE/2` (uses the interpolated render `x`, so deaths stay in sync with what's on screen).
- `Obstacle.overlapsX(cx, half)` / `Obstacle.containsX(cx)` test against the obstacle's **visible** body (inset `VISUAL_INSET = 3px` from the raw AABB, since cars/logs are drawn inset). This is what fixed the old "muere cuando no debería": the previous padded AABB counted a ~4px visible gap as a hit.
- Roads: die when the frog's hitbox (`FROG_HITBOX_HALF = 9`, slightly smaller than the 10px body so near-misses survive) overlaps a car's visible body.
- Rivers: the frog floats when its **centre** sits over a log/turtle (generous, so log edges are safe); otherwise it drowns. `Frog.update` still handles being carried off-screen by a log.

If tuning fairness: raise `FROG_HITBOX_HALF` (constants.ts) to make cars deadlier, lower it to be more forgiving; `VISUAL_INSET` (Obstacle.ts) must track how far obstacle bodies are drawn inside their cell.

## Rendering

`game/Renderer.ts` is 2D canvas, neon-on-dark. Lanes: grass (two-tone turf + stable scattered tufts / pebbles / glowing flowers), road (asphalt gradient + dashed yellow centre line, dash offset per row), river (deep-water gradient + two layered animated ripples). Obstacles: cars (body + darkened cabin/windshield, gloss strip, wheels, leading headlights), logs (bark gradient + end-grain rings + grain line), turtles (segmented shell + head poking in the travel direction). The frog has a hop arc, a ground shadow that shrinks mid-hop, and a belly highlight. Per-row decorations are seeded by `rowRandom(row, salt)` so they stay put instead of flickering each frame.

## Sound

`game/SoundEffects.ts` synthesizes all audio with the Web Audio API (no assets): a blip on each hop, a wet plop on a river drowning, and a harsh squash on a car hit or falling off screen. `killFrog(cause)` picks the death sound from its `"water" | "crash"` cause.

## Room mode (multiplayer)

Wired to the shared party mode: the constructor calls `initRoomMode("mini-frogger", { getScore: () => this.score })` (see root `CLAUDE.md`, "Salas (multiplayer rooms)"). With `?room=` in the URL the game-over reports the score to the room instead of the global ranking, and the restart input is blocked (one run per round). Without the param nothing changes.
