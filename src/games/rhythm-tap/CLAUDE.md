# Rhythm Tap

Three-lane note-tapping game. Pieces of four **figures** (circle, triangle, diamond, square) fall down three columns; each figure has its own arrow key (left / up / down / right), independent of the lane. You press the piece's figure key as it crosses the hit line near the bottom (or, on touch, tap the column the piece is in). A hit is judged Perfecto / Bien by how close the piece was to the line; pressing with no matching figure in range, or letting a piece fall past the line, is a Fallo. Perfect/Good hits score points (with a combo bonus) and heal a little; misses drain a health bar. The run is endless and ends when health hits 0 — score survives as the local best. Plain 2D `<canvas>`, no Three.js.

**Figure and lane are decoupled.** `LANE_COUNT` (currently 3) is only position; `FIGURES` (4 shapes) is only identity. At spawn a piece picks a random lane and a random figure, independently — so any shape can fall in any column and the lane never tells you which key to press. The key comes from the figure, drawn on the piece plus a figure→key legend below the hit line.

**Figure presses flash the right column.** A key press is judged by figure across all lanes, so `NoteField` records `lastHitLane` (the column of the piece it cleared) and `Game` flashes that column for feedback — the lane is "taken into account" for the effect even though it isn't a correctness condition.

## Module layout

- `main.ts` — entry point, mounts `Game` into `#app`.
- `game/Game.ts` — orchestrates the canvas, the `ready → playing → dead` state machine and the `requestAnimationFrame` loop. Owns score/combo/health, the canvas→window letterbox scaling, and the inverse pointer→lane mapping.
- `game/NoteField.ts` — spawns/moves/recycles pieces (random lane + random figure), ramps difficulty (speed, spawn rate) with score, and resolves a press into the nearest piece's `Judgment` via `tapFigure(figure)` (match by shape, any lane) or `tapLane(lane)` (match by column). Also reports pieces that auto-missed by falling past the line.
- `game/Renderer.ts` — all canvas drawing (lane backdrop, hit line, neutral landing rings, pieces drawn as their figure with the key label, the figure→key legend, per-column flash), in view units. `drawFigure` traces each shape by its `FIGURES` name.
- `game/InputController.ts` — figure keys → `onFigure(figure)`; pointer → `onLane(lane)` (column under the tap).
- `game/Hud.ts` — DOM overlay (score, combo, best, health bar, judgment popup, start / game-over screens).
- `game/SoundEffects.ts` — synthesized Web Audio feedback tones (no assets, no backing track): a bright note on Perfecto and a softer one on Bien (both climb a pentatonic ladder with the combo so runs sound melodic), a dull buzz on Fallo, and a descending figure on game over.
- `game/constants.ts` — all tunable values (lanes, speeds, spawn rate, judgment windows, scoring, health). **Tune here first.**

## Non-obvious decisions

**Fixed view box, scaled to fit.** Like the other games, everything is authored in a fixed `VIEW_WIDTH`×`VIEW_HEIGHT` (480×720 portrait) space and letterboxed into the window via `ctx.scale()` + `ctx.translate()` (with `devicePixelRatio` folded into the scale). All note/lane logic works in view units and never touches window pixels.

**Pointer→lane needs the inverse transform.** Because the view box is scaled/offset into the window, `Game.toViewX()` undoes that (`(clientX - rect.left) / fit - offsetX`) so a click maps to the correct lane. `InputController` is handed that function rather than reimplementing the math.

**No fixed chart.** There's no music track to sync against, so notes spawn on a timer (not on musical beats) and difficulty is driven purely by the score: `NoteField` raises fall speed and shrinks the spawn interval as points climb. "Rhythm" is the visual cadence of notes reaching the line, not an audio beat map. Hits do play synthesized feedback tones (see `SoundEffects.ts`) whose pitch climbs a pentatonic ladder with the combo, so a clean run turns into a rising melody — but that's reactive per-tap feedback, not a chart the player follows.

**Two judgment modes, one piece pool.** Keyboard judges by figure (`tapFigure`) so a piece in any column is cleared with its figure key; touch judges by column (`tapLane`) since you physically tap where the piece is. Both share `NoteField.judge()`.

**Empty presses count as misses.** A press with no matching note inside `GOOD_WINDOW` returns `null` and `Game` treats it as a miss (breaks combo, drains health), so mashing is punished.

**`dt` is clamped** (`MAX_DT`) so a tab-switch or hitch can't integrate one giant step and teleport notes through the hit line.

**Enter-to-start countdown.** From the start or game-over screen, Enter (via the new `onStart` callback in `InputController`) or a figure-key / column tap enters a `countdown` state that shows 3 / 2 / 1 / YA (`COUNTDOWN_LABELS`, `COUNTDOWN_STEP` seconds each, in `Game.ts`) before play begins. `beginInput()` now returns `true` only while playing, so taps on a non-playing screen just kick off the countdown instead of being judged. `Hud.showCountdown(text | null)` renders the big centered label (styled by `.countdown` in `style.css`).

## Room mode (multiplayer)

Wired to the shared party mode: the constructor calls `initRoomMode("rhythm-tap", { getScore: () => this.score })` (see root `CLAUDE.md`, "Salas (multiplayer rooms)"). With `?room=` in the URL the game-over reports the score to the room instead of the global ranking, and the restart input is blocked (one run per round). Without the param nothing changes.
